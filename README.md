# Client-side web application playground

This is a brief ReactJS/RequireJS starter project, or a simple bootstrap, for web developers who just want to start simple from scratch. No fluff, just start coding right away on HTML5/CSS and Javascript as soon as you clone the project!

## How To Dev

1. Install node w. npm
2. Install grunt with `npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run `grunt` to start server and browse to index

To get started look at `www/index.html` and `www/scripts/main.js`. There is a simple ReactJS component written in JSX at `www/scripts/timer.jsx.js`.

# Notes for Web Devs

This project is set up to use [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html), [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and default [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) from when you clone this repository.

The [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) is set up to the [watch task](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch). Javascript files are monitored by default and are running through [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/).
